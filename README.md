# syte.f.c 


Frontend home test for syte.io.
Lang: JS.
Workfame: React.js.


My initial idea was to set up a backend with database and use MVC design pattern but my solution here was satisfying for the task in hand.


# Dependencies: 
    axios,
    react ,
    react-dom,
    react-redux,
    react-router-dom ,
    react-scripts,
    sass.
    
    
    
To maintain the favorite team I used the local storage to save the data when a team is being favored.
After page refresh, the favorite team will still be marked, only after clearing the local storage, all selected favorite teams will be gone.


The design was made by me. 
The application is mobile friendly and web.


I developed this app on Windows machine and Chrome developer browser.
Everything has been tested and work as designed on my end.
